# Voice of tone

Our voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like us. At the same time, some aspects of our personality might be more or less apparent, depending on the audience and their context. That’s tone.

## Our voice

Simply put, we’re a company, built by real people who understand this business and care about helping others succeed.
That should be clear every time someone uses our products or services.
Most often, we show this through well-crafted experience that help founder get their jobs done efficiently. But there are times when our personalities and perspectives should be more apparent. In those times, we should adapt our tone to respond to people in an appropriate and meaningful way.

## Guidelines

#### Be real, but not too tough or overly familiar

- Use business casual language—be plain-spoken, not pretentious or overly playful.
- Be upfront and honest with users, even if we make a mistake.
- Communicate with clarity and empathy—be direct, not insensitive.
- Write short and jargon free copy as you speak to your coworker or friend.

#### Be proactive, but not needy or pushy

- Offer users sincere encouragement and practical advice.
- Clearly explain how users are impacted when something goes wrong, but don’t over explain with redundant content.
- Avoid words that generalize success like “every,” “all,” and “most”.
- Use language that supports action, movement, and progress.

#### Guide, but don’t handhold or prescribe

- Use expertise to help users succeed; don’t talk down to them
- Be specific when explaining benefits without making things sound better than they are
- Teach people the “why” and “how” behind actions—don’t just tell them to do something

## Everyday tasks and activities

We want people to feel like they can accomplish whatever they’re trying to do. Our experiences should give people confidence that they’re capable of achieving their goals, no matter their level of experience.

- Look for the simplest way to communicate information—words aren’t always necessary.
- Don’t add extra text just to fill space.
- Help people understand why they should do something, not just how.
- Break down complicated tasks into steps that help people focus on one thing at a time.

## Errors

While we do our best to be proactive and protect against unexpected events, they still happen. These are often simple mistakes or roadblocks to action that can easily be fixed. Although they aren’t necessarily errors or problems, they can feel that way at first.
In this case, our job is to help people understand what happened so that they can get back to work as quickly as possible.

- Clearly explain the situation and how it can be resolved.
- Don’t user error numbers or code unless they’re easily recognizable by people and help them solve the problem.
- Explain the impact on their business clearly, without using confusing or scary language.
- Apologize and empathize when we’re at fault, but within reason.
- Provide clear steps to resolve issues. If there’s no solution, be direct about what that means for the users and what we’re doing about it.

## Introducing new products and updates

It’s exciting to launch a new feature or update, but always consider the audience’s perspective first. While we may be excited about the benefits and capabilities, change can be intimidating or annoying for users.
When you’re announcing something new, focus on educating and explaining what it is, what it’s used for, and what the user can expect.

- Pitch our product by explaining the specific founder benefits.
- If possible, let users dismiss announcements or postpone changes until they’re ready.

## Writing with AI

Feel free to use AI tools to iterate on your copies and come up with your first draft that you want to communicate. however it’s important to:

- Since AI often provides the most generic and overly optimistic copy, it must be reviewed multiple times.
- The copy should not give the impression that it was generated by AI. One way to determine if content is AI-generated is to identify words that are not commonly used in everyday conversations with friends or coworkers. For example, "streamline" is a term rarely spoken in casual dialogue.
- Avoid using jargon words like streamline, enhanced, believe.
- Use AI promote tailer for ux writing. [example](https://ray.so/presets/preset/ux-copywriter).
- Give clear context to get better result.
